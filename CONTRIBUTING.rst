Contribute
===========
If you want to contribute code:

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix based on master.
* Run the tests (See below).
* Add tests for your feature if you can and it is appropriate. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with version.
* Send me a pull request, let me know what tests fail as a result of the changes.

If you want to contribute ideas:

* Just open an issue with your idea

Tests

and::
